                <h5>Technocapitalism refers to changes in capitalism associated with the emergence of new technology sectors, the power of corporations, and new forms of organization. The problem with technocapitalism revolves around the fact that information is now controlled by the limited number of companies who are participating in tech driven markets.</h5>

                    For as long as there has been currency, humans have been exploring “get rich quick” schemes. In this era, tech is the gold rush.

With budding sub-industries like NFTs, big data, and gaming growing everywhere everyone wants their slice of the pie. 
                    A direct quote from ITIF tells us that “The number of technology-based start-ups surged 47 percent in the last decade. These firms still account for a relatively small share of all businesses, but they have an outsized impact on economic growth because they provide better-paying, longer-lasting jobs than other start-ups, and they contribute more to innovation, productivity, and competitiveness.”

                    In a perfect world, these can only be seen as positives, however, with every potential reward, the risk is there to match.

Of course, the word “fail” is open to interpretation, employees who are cautious about what contracts they sign can minimize their risk by working for a fixed salary and forfeit equity and potential for income growth should the company see success.  This means that any risk falls on the founding team while employees can be somewhat comfortable knowing they have a stable income.

                With the introduction of new technologies capitalism has adapted with it. Whether it's the rate of exploitation or how technology is used to make us addicted to our devices, it's everywhere. Exploitation has always been a key ingredient in how capitalism works and with how new technology is made it is no different. If we take a look at the iphone this is extremely evident. If the iPhone x was made in the U.S. it would be extremely unaffordable to most people. According to the Institute of Social Research if the iPhone x was manufactured in the U.S. it would cost an estimate of $30,000 per phone. Yet today the iPhone X price starts at only $999, that's $29,001 less than the estimate of one made in the U.S. So how is this fair? The answer is it's not, it's just capitalism. The issue with capitalism is that exploitation isn’t an extraordinary concept, it's one of the building blocks of the economic system. The goal of capitalism is to squeeze as much profit out as possible and this is why the iPhone x like many other apple products are made outside of the U.S. The main reasons for this are the cost of labor being much cheaper as well as the adverse working conditions. Meaning that in other countries such as China there are no trade unions and longer working hours. Apple also pays only around 2% in taxes along the Global Commodity Chain compared to the 35% they would have to pay if the iPhone was produced in the U.S. One of the biggest weapons in reducing the cost of production is through mechanization which is the investment in new technology to speed up production. New technology is used in order to increase and manage labor productivity. This ultimately leads to the idea of labor productivity which forces workers to increase their labor intensity for the same pay.             </h2>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
                Amazon has one of the most obvious ways of using technology as mechanization to increase productivity in their workers. Amazon uses computers to track the amount of work you’ve done in comparison to the expected goal. Ilya Geller who previously worked for Amazon as a stower explained how they exploit their employees through mechanization, ‘“You’re being tracked by a computer the entire time you’re there. You don’t get reported or written up by managers. You get written up by an algorithm,” said Geller. “You’re keenly aware there is an algorithm keeping track of you, making sure you keep going as fast as you can, because if there is too much time lapsed between items, the computer will know this, will write you up, and you will get fired.”’ Geller also mentioned that it only takes 2 to 3 write ups to get fired. Many workers have testified to Amazon’s grueling working conditions. Workers are expected to scan 1,800 packages an hour which equals to scanning 30 packages per minute. Being constantly watched by machines and bordered off from speaking to other coworkers. Employees have compared working there to a prison with their extremely short break times, high injury rates and putting machines above their actual workers.
                In the end we see advancement in technology has only brought upon increasing the rate of exploitation as well as technology being made through exploitation.

                We live in an immersive world where we have two lives, virtual reality, and physical reality. According to a New York Times article, “We’re entering the metaverse era — an age in which more of our daily interactions and experiences will occur inside immersive digital worlds, rather than in offline physical spaces.” This might sound very scary to many people; however, technology can also help us equalize the power of everyone. People can be anywhere and do the same job and get paid the same amount. 

                NFT stands for Non-Fungible Tokens. According to Forbes, it is a “digital asset representing real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. NFTs are often bought through cryptocurrency. NFTs are created through Graphic Art, GIFS, videos and sports highlights, Music, Virtual Avatars, Designer Sneakers, and many more art collectibles. NFTs are collectible items you have exclusive ownership of, and the buyer gets a digital file. Nowadays, depending on what NFT you bought, you can also receive a physical copy. 
                
                Some people think that investing in NFTs is uncertain and risky, but as a creator, NFT is great for creators/artists to expose and sell their art.
